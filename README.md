## Introduction

For this project I was approached by an education specialist with [OUSD](https://www.ousd.org/)'s ( Oakland Unified School District's ) [Young Adult Program](https://www.ousd.org/specialeducation/programs/young-adult-program), in order to create a bespoke webpage for YAP Makerspace. We then discussed desired features and necessary technologies, which can be found in the following section of this README. The client's goal for this project is to provide YAP students a gallery to both display and sell their artwork to the general public, as well as to provide information about the program and its students.

## Features

The client requested the following features for this project:

- Home, About Makerspace, About YAP, Art Gallery, Artist in Residence, Student Hub, and Student Info pages ( possibly consolidating some pages ).
- Footer w/ collaboration message/links, copyright info and resource credits.
- Accessibility-first responsive design, compliant with WCAG 2.2 guidelines.
- An "Accessibility Options" dropdown where users can toggle site features to suit their individual needs.

After discussing features, I provided the client with several layout and color scheme mockups. After a period of deliberation and feedback, the following design was approved by the client:
